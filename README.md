# Codeigniter 3 Authentication Starter Kit  
It's basically a Codeigniter 3 starter app, but with additional feature, Authentication features. It provides some authentication features like:
1. Login
2. Register
3. Email Verfication
4. Reset Password
5. Remember Me  
  
For **Reset Password** feature, **you must enable Email Verification feature first**, because The Reset Password feature need an email to sends a reset link.  
  
With provided features above, you don't need to think or create an authentication by yourself. You can focus build your service or your own feature.  
  
**Note:**
- This app use Tabler template, because it's open source and has rich components. It also provides many svg icons that can be used within your project.  
- It's not a perfect app. It still has many lack. So, I would be happy if you wanted to contribute to this project. You can clone this repository or fork this repository if you want to contribute.
